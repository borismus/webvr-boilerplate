# WebVR Boilerplate

A [THREE.js][three]-based starting point for cross-platform web-based VR
experiences.

This project relies heavily on the [WebVR Polyfill][polyfill] to provide VR
support if the [WebVR API][spec] is not implemented. It also uses the [WebVR
UI][ui] project to render the UI to enter VR and magic window modes. See here
for a [live demo][demo].
