# WebVR Boilerplate

A [THREE.js][three]-based starting point for VR experiences that work well in
both Google Cardboard and other VR headsets. Also provides a fallback for
experiencing the same content without requiring a VR device.

This project relies heavily on the [webvr-polyfill][polyfill] to provide VR
support even if the WebVR spec is not implemented.

## Getting started

The easiest way to start is to fork this repository or copy its contents into a
new directory.

Alternatively, you can start from scratch. The key parts that the boilerplate
provides are:

1. Include webvr-polyfill.js in your project.
2. Include webvr-manager.js and instantiate a WebVRManager object,
   passing in your VREffect instance as well as THREE.js' WebGLRenderer (from
   the THREE.js effect library) as first argument.

For example,

    var effect = new THREE.VREffect(renderer);
    var manager = new WebVRManager(renderer, effect);

The manager handles going in and out of VR mode. Instead of calling
`renderer.render()` or `effect.render()`, you call `manager.render()`, which
renders in monocular view by default, or side-by-side binocular view when in VR
mode.

The polyfill and boilerplate are also available via bower. Easy install:

    bower install webvr-boilerplate

## Features and known issues

Features:

- Enter and exit VR mode (in WebVR and WebVR polyfill compatible environments).
- Immersive fullscreen, orientation locking and sleep prevention.
- Distortion correction, enabled in iOS only. 
- High quality head tracking with motion prediction thanks to webvr-polyfill.

Bugs and known issues:

- Proper distortion correction for Android. This requires knowing physical
  locations of lenses, which requires knowing device's DPI, which is hard in
  general. It's easier in iOS because there are relatively few iPhone models.
- Wake lock for Android currently relies on a hack in which a hidden video is
  played on repeat in the background. This causes big WebGL performance issues,
  so has been disabled. This will be resolved when the official wakelock API
  lands: <http://crbug.com/257511>

## Configuration 

All configuration is done through the global `window.WebVRConfig` object. You 
can use the following properties:

- `FORCE_DISTORTION` (Boolean): Set this to `true` to enable barrel distortion
  for cardboard devices, even if the device has unknown display properties.
- `PREVENT_DISTORTION` (Boolean): Set this to `true` to prevent barrel
  distortion for cardboard devices, even if it is a known device. Do this if you
  encounter issues with barrel distortion on cardboard devices.
- `DISTORTION_BGCOLOR` (Object): Use this to change the background color used
  in the barrel distortion shader pass (cardboard devices). Pass an object with
  `x`, `y`, `z` and `w` properties (type number, ranged 0..1).

Here is an example of WebVRConfig usage:

    WebVRConfig = {
      // Forces cardboard distortion in VR mode.
      //FORCE_DISTORTION: true, // Default: false.
      // Prevents cardboard distortion in VR mode
      //PREVENT_DISTORTION: true, // Default: false.
      // Override the cardboard distortion background color.
      //DISTORTION_BGCOLOR: {x: 1, y: 0, z: 0, w: 1}, // Default: (0,0,0,1).
    };

In addition to `render()`, WebVRManager provides a sparse API surface:

- `isVRMode()` (Boolean): True if and only if currently in VR mode.
- `getViewer()` (Object): Information about the Cardboard-like viewer that
  is currently selected. Viewers are pre-defined in `device-info.js`.

As well as emitting the following events:

- `modechange`: When the user changes the current mode.
- `viewerchange`: When the user selects a new viewer.
